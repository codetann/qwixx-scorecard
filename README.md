# Qwixx Scorecard

This project was made using React, Styled Components, and Local Storage.

## About

I wanted to create a score card for the board game Qwixx for a few reasons.

1. It will save paper.
2. We dont need to have a pen and paper present.
3. To impress friends and family with my progress in web development.

### `Bugs`

This is a beta build and is currently still in development. There are a few bugs and features that still need
to be implemented.

### `Future Features`

1. Ability to roll dice in game.
2. Cross out and disable numbers behind the toggled numbers.
3. Connect with others and play the game.
4. Add better styling to app.

### `Link`

Currently there is no production link. Check back for more details.
